= Jakarta Data and NoSQL Prototype
:toc: auto
:toclevels: 2

This repository is a prototype for exploring and utilizing the Jakarta Data StaticMetamodel annotation. The goal is to generate a model for Jakarta NoSQL and Jakarta Persistence entities using two different approaches: one at build time using a Java Annotation Processor and the other at runtime using reflection and CDI extension.

== Build Time Generation

In this approach, a Java Annotation Processor is used to generate a final and immutable model at build time. The processor generates `AttributeInfo` implementations using a Mustache template as immutable classes.

== Runtime Generation

The second approach involves using reflection and CDI extension to generate the model at runtime. It scans a `StaticMetamodel` class and sets the instances matching the field names.

=== Project Structure

The project is structured into three main folders:

==== `build-time`

The `build-time` folder contains the project engine for generating classes at build time. It uses a Mustache template to generate immutable `AttributeInfo` implementations. This approach ensures compile-time safety and efficiency.

==== `runtime`

The `runtime` folder contains the engine that operates in reflection with CDI. It scans a `StaticMetamodel` class and sets instances matching the field names. This approach allows for runtime generation and flexibility.

==== `entity-sample-build`

The `entity-sample-build` folder includes sample entities and tests for the build-time project. This folder is a useful resource to demonstrate and test the build-time generation process.

Each of these folders serves a specific purpose in the prototype's development.
